    <h1> Chrome Dev Tools: Security  </h1> 
    <p> You can use the security tab in chrome developer tools to find out if your page is secure, identify possible security vulnerabilities or view security certificate details. </p>
    <p> If your page is secure, the security overview will have the message "This page is secure (valid HTTPS)". </p>
    <p> When it comes to unsecure pages the security panel distinguishes between two different types. </p>
    <p> If your site is served over HTTP, it will inform you that the Main Origin isn’t secure. </p>
    <p> If your site is served over HTTPS, but makes HTTP requests to other origins for resources, it will give you a mixed content warning, listing these origins under “Non-secure-origins”. </p>
