    <h1> Chrome Dev Tools: Device Mode </h1>  
    <p> Device mode in the Chrome Developer Tools can be used to simulate how your page or app would look on different mobile screens. For this reason then it is useful to help a developer build mobile first websites and responsive websites in general. </p>
    <p> You can change what paticular device you want to emulate it on with the viewport controls, it has a responsive, resizable option and device specific options, akin to the screen size of a range of popular devices. 
    It's also possible to add your own custom device presets, if none of these options satisfy your needs. </p>
    <p> You can also use the device mode to test how capable your page or app would be on different networks through network conditioning. 
    That being said, it has it's limitations, it can't emulate device hardware behaviour for example, so while a useful tool, it is not a replacement for real thorough testing on a range of devices. </p>
