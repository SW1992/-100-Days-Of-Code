    <h1> Chrome Dev Tools: Audits </h1> 
    <p> The auditing tab in the chrome developer tools, can be used to analyse a page and get suggestions on how you can improve that pages performance. The analysis will be done as the pageloads so the suggestions it makes can provide insights on how to decrease the time your page takes to load. </p>
    <p> Often, the more easily effectible changes will be listed under web page performance, which can give you insights into CSS rules that aren't being used in your current page. </p>
    <p> It can also give you tips how to improve the load order of files in your page, for example, if you loaded some external JavaScript in the head of a document before external CSS files, it will inform you of this and suggest you move these stylesheet references before the script tags. </p>
    <p> These are just two examples of things it can tell you about there. A network utilization audit can also give you more insights, into things like caching and cookie size. </p>
