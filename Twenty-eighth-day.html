    <h1> CSS Pre-processors & LESS </h1>
    <p> CSS pre-processors are style sheet languages 
    that can be used to extend plain CSS allowing a developer to write cleaner code &
    save time, by storing & re-using functionality. </p>
 
    <h3> LESS </h3>
    <p> One of the more popular pre-processors, is LESS, often compared to the also popular Sass. </p>
    <p> LESS, was first built with the Ruby programming language like Sass, but is now based in Javascript. </p>
    <p> Both can be thought of as scripting languages that aim to make CSS more powerful, versatile & customizable. </p></p>
 
    <h3> Using LESS </h3>
    <p> To use LESS you must first save your CSS file with the ".less" extension. </p>
    <p> It's possible to use it locally, on the client-side, by linking to it in your page, like you would a normal CSS stylesheet,
    changing the rel attribute slighty.  </p>
    <code> &lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less"&#47;&gt; </code>
    <p> You also need to download the less.js file from the http://lesscss.org/ site, and follow your stylesheet/stylesheets
    with a script tag like this. </p>    
    <code>  &lt;script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"&gt; &lt;&#47;script&gt; </code>
    <p> For production, if your new to pre-processors like me, it's recommended you use 3rd party compiliation software to install it. 
    Such as Koala or Codekit, or one of the many others. </p>
