    <h1> LESS Scope & Extend </h1>
  
    <h3> LESS Scope </h3> 
    <p> The concept of scope in LESS, is similar to the concept of scope in programming languages broadly. </p>
    <p> When you declare variables and use them in a nested structure, the complier will look for the variable in the local scope first. </p>
    <p> If it isn't found locally, it will then look for a value in the elements parent scope, and continue up the scope chain until it either find's a definition for the variable, or doesn't. </p>

      <h3> Scope Output </h3>
        <summary> 
          <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p>  
        </summary>    
    </header>
  
    <h3> LESS Extend </h3>  
    <p> You can use the extend concept in LESS to share properties from, one class or selector to the next. </p>
    <p> It is essentially the same concept wise, as a mixin, but has slighty different syntax. </p>
    <p> You use it with the syntax <code> &:extend(selector) </code> </p>
