    <h1> The Document Object Model </h1>  
    <p> The DOM is an application programming interface for HTML and XML documents that defines a representation of the nodes of that document in the browser, so that they can be accessed and manipulated, without changing the original HTML or XML document. </p>
    <p> Scripting languages like JavaScript and libraries like jQuery allow for easy manipulation of the DOM and allow for dynamic creation or deletion of HTML elements, altering of CSS styles, and reaction to physical events that occur on the elements of a webpage. </p>
    <p> Historically the JavaScript language and the DOM have been tightly connected, particularly in its early stages, but the DOM itself was actually designed to be language agnostic, as well as being cross-platform, so a DOM can actually be implemented into and manipulated with any programming language.</p>
