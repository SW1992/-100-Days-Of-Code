  <h1> Chrome Dev Tools: Sources </h1> 
  <p> The sources tab is very useful for debugging JavaScript code. It allows you to set breakpoints, which can be used to pause execution of JavaScript code at certain points. </p>
  <p> This could be at a particular line of code or DOM event, you can even have conditional break points, that are only set if a paticular condition evaluates to true. If you set multiple breakpoints, you can then pace step by step through these breakpoints, observing what happens at each set stage of your app. </p>
  <p> This is very useful, for helping fix errors, particularly with larger projects. It could help you deduce which piece of logic isn’t functioning the way you think it is, or why a particular function isn’t returning the value you want. </p>
