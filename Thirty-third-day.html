  <h1> BEM </h1>  
  
  <h3> BEM & it's uses. </h3>
  <p> BEM or Block, Element, Modifier is a CSS naming convention
  which defines a set of rules for developers to use when naming their CSS classes. </p>
  <p> It aims to make codebases more maintainable & easier to read, paticulary on large projects, 
  defining a rigid system for developers & development teams to follow. </p>
  <p> And from personal expierence, when it comes to programming naming things can be hard, BEM, 
  aswell as other methodologies like OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS) aim to remedy this problem. </p>
