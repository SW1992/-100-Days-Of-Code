  <h1> Chrome Dev Tools: Elements </h1> 
  <p> You can use the elements tab in the chrome developer tools to tweak the CSS rules & HTML mark-up of your webpage/website. </p>
  <p> As well as basic things like changing the background colour property of specific elements you can also tweak their layout. </p>
  <p> You can do this through a box model in the computed pane, that lets you change values for properties like, border, margin & padding. </p>
  <p> Edits are viewable in real time, so you can see the effect changes would have on your webpage, as you change property values. </p>
  <p> However, changes arenâ€™t saved in normal circumstances, when you refresh the page the changes will be gone, unless you set up the persistent authoring feature. </p>
