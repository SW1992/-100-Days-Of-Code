# -100-Days-Of-Code

I'm taking part in this challenge,  i plan to upload some code everyday for the next 100 days.

These will be small programs sharing my understanding of new concepts i'm currently trying to learn, 

or concepts which i have some knowledge of, that i'm trying to reinforce.

I will spend at least an hour on a day on this.

This challenge is completely inspired by Alexander Kallaway & his recent medium article.
