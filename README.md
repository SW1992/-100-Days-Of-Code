# 100-Days-Of-Code

I plan to upload some code everyday for the next 100 days.

These will be programs sharing my understanding of new concepts i'm currently trying to learn, or concepts which i have some knowledge of, that i'm trying to reinforce.

I will spend at least an hour a day on this.

This challenge is inspired by Alexander Kallaway & his recent medium article.

Half way though the #100DaysOfCode, I decided I wanted to work on a couple of projects, to consolidate some of the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained.

I have now finished my #100DaysOfCode challenge, i tweeted all my daily progress here https://twitter.com/SamWhitman1992.
