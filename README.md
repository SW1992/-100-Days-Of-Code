# 100-Days-Of-Code

i plan to upload some code everyday for the next 100 days.

These will be programs sharing my understanding of new concepts i'm currently trying to learn, 

or concepts which i have some knowledge of, that i'm trying to reinforce.

I will spend at least an hour a day on this.

This challenge is inspired by Alexander Kallaway & his recent medium article.

Edit: Now I’m over the half way into #100DaysOfCode, I’ve decided I want to work on a couple of projects & consolidate some of the  knowledge I’ve gained, MTF.
