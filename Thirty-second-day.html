  <h1> LESS Import </h1>
  
  <h3> LESS Import </h3>
  <p> The @import rule in CSS, can be used to import rule-sets into a file, from other external stylesheets. </p>
  <p> In LESS @import differs somewhat, firstly, In Normal CSS, the @import rule must come before all other types rules. </p>
  <p> In LESS, you can pretty much put the @import rule where ever you want, you could put it after everything else in the LESS file 
  if you wanted & it would still be valid. </p>
  <p> You also have extensions on the @import rule, in the form of import options, which can be used to give you more versatility over how external files are handled. </p>
  <p> I will look at one of the most popular, the reference option. </p>
  <p> It differs from an normal import, in that, normal imports simply dump the imported content into the file requesting it, 
  including rule-sets for example, in the compiled output. </p> 
  <p> Were as reference import's will only include imported code in the compiled output, if that code is referenced. </p>
